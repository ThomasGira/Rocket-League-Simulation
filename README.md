## Introduction
This document outlines the work I did to create a Simulator for my teams MCEN 5115 Mechatronics 1 Project. This was done in order to practice and tune game playing algorithms without using a physical robot. This could be performed in a simulatro such as WeBots however this allowed for the learning of openCV. Working on this aspect of our project gave me a chane to learn openCV while contributing to our ptoject. Ultimately this algortihm was not used due to the overhead camera speed and the integration of our robot.
